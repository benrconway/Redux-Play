This is my code example from coding along with Dan Abramov(EggHead.io) on the topic of Redux.

I am learning this as I wish to implement it in an application project of my own called "Community Works" or something similar. A web application where people can donate time to share skills, knowledge or time they have with no money being exchanged.

Following on from practicing this, I will also be looking into how to implement user log-in, so as to create a more personalised experience and add a layer of individual responsibility and reward for community growing behaviour.
